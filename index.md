I study questions in labor and urban economics by applying methods from spatial economics and insights from economic history. My research focuses on the causes and consequences of inequality in cities and often employs large-scale administrative datasets for the United States. 

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from MIT  in 2024 and my B.A. in Economics and B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Stanford in 2018. 

From 2020 to 2024 during my Ph.D., I was also employed at the Census Bureau's [Center for Economic Studies](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ces.html) to build new measures of intergenerational mobility for the post-Civil Rights era.
