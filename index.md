description: Assistant Professor at UC Berkeley Haas. Research in labor & urban economics, inequality, intergenerational mobility, housing, and infrastructure.
---
I am a labor and urban economist. My research focuses on the causes and consequences of inequality in the U.S. and draws upon methods from spatial economics and economic history. 

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from MIT in 2024 and my B.A. in Economics and B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Stanford in 2018. Before joining UC Berkeley, I was a post-doctoral fellow at Stanford from 2024 to 2025. 

From 2020 to 2024 during my Ph.D., I worked part-time at the Census Bureau's [Center for Economic Studies](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ces.html) to build new measures of intergenerational mobility for the mid-20th century.
