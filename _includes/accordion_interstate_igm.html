  <p>This paper measures the aggregate impacts of a prominent place-based policy, Interstate highway infrastructure, on the local economic development of 
    neighborhoods and the intergenerational outcomes of children. I employ novel parent-child linkages for the near universe of 57 million individuals 
    born between 1964 and 1979. Greater commuting access from Interstate construction increases average income and employment rates of existing residents. 
    Given the large-scale nature of the policy, equilibrium effects emerge with targeted census tracts experiencing inflows of higher occupational status, 
    higher educated, and white households. Combining a movers design with spatial variation from the highway shock, I demonstrate that children causally 
    benefit from growing up in neighborhoods with higher average income and higher SES peers. Spillover effects through migration lead locations with lower 
    access improvements to worsen in peer quality, which adversely affects children. I develop a general framework for evaluating the equilibrium 
    intergenerational impacts of place-based interventions. Under this framework, population reallocation and changes in neighborhood composition 
    cancel out for children's outcomes, while direct economic access benefits boost economic mobility.
