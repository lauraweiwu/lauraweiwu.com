    <p>We study the channels through which changes in local economic conditions
    during early childhood affect long-run outcomes for children from differing
    economic backgrounds. We exploit geographic variation across counties in the
    decline of manufacturing employment during the 1979 to 1984 period with
    microdata from the Longitudinal Business Database. To assess the exogeneity
    of local labor market shocks, we construct additional shocks by combining
    industry-level energy intensity with spikes in oil prices as a result of the 1979
    energy crisis. With administrative and survey data that trace the full trajectory
    of the childrenâ€™s lives, we measure how these local changes impact educational
    attainment, income, and the quality of the firm of employment in the modern
    day. We explore how migration of parents away from counties experiencing
    declines and changes in parental income during childhood are central mediators
    for our findings.
